12. Describe a future aim.
what the aim is
when you hope to achieve it
what you need to do to reach your goal
and why this goal is important to you.
I’m going to describe a future aim of mine, which is to write a book. I’d
like to write a novel, so the story or plot would be fictional, but it
would probably be influenced by some of my own experiences, ideas
and views.
Unfortunately I have no idea where to start or what my novel would
be about, so I can’t imagine achieving this aim until later in my life.
Maybe it will be something that I do as a hobby when I retire, or I
might suddenly be inspired to start writing much sooner. It’s just a
vague objective at the moment.
I think it must be extremely difficult to find the motivation to write a
novel, so more than anything I would need time, commitment and the
passion to keep working until I finished. I would probably need to set a
goal of writing for a certain amount of time each day, and of course I’d
need a good idea for a story in the first place.
This goal interests me because I’ve always wondered how people
manage to create a work of fiction from nothing; I’ve always wondered
whether I could do the same, and whether I’d be capable of bringing a
story to life. I’ve always enjoyed reading, and I’d like to follow in the
footsteps of my favourite authors.

8. Describe an educational television programme that you liked.
You should say
what the programme was about
when and where you saw it
how you found out about this programme
and why you liked it.
I’m going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV
programmes, which is a nature documentary called ‘Planet Earth’
There were eleven episodes of this programme, and each one
featured a different habitat on Earth, such as mountains, caves,
deserts and jungles. The aim of the ‘Planet Earth’ series was to take
the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of
interesting animals, plants and landscapes.
I first saw ‘Planet Earth’ on television when it was broadcast by the
BBC several years ago. I think it was shown every Sunday evening,
which was the perfect time to watch a fascinating nature
programme. Then, a few years a ago, somebody bought me the DVD
box set of the whole series as a Christmas present, and I watched
the episodes again.
I found out about this TV programme because it was advertised
repeatedly in the weeks before it was first aired. The TV trailers
were really eye-catching because they showed incredibly beautiful
images of nature. I also recognised the voice of the narrator of the
programme, the well-knownnaturalist David Attenborough. It was
these trailers that persuaded me to watch the first episode.
What I liked most about the ‘Planet Earth’ series was its stunning
photography and its global scope. For example, in the “Fresh Water”
episode, they showed us the giant salamander in Japan, crocodiles
in the river Nile, and river dolphins in the Amazon. I was amazed at
how they had managed to film such interesting creatures in so
many locations. I enjoyed learning about strange animal species,
and the programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our
planet.

9. Describe a change that you would like to see in your local area.
You should say
what the change would be
who would be involved in making the change
how it would be done
and why you would like to see the change happen.
The change that I’d like to see in my local neighbourhood is the
pedestrianisation of the main shopping street in the town centre. I’d like
to see traffic diverted around this area in order to make it safer and
more attractive for visitors and shoppers. Most of the traffic that clogs
up the main street is just passing through the town, but it’s the local
people who have to put up with the congestion, noise and pollution.
It’s the job of the local council to make changes like the one I’m
suggesting. But before the council does anything, there usually needs to
be some pressure from local people to bring a problem to light. So,
perhaps we need a campaign by local residents who want to see this
change. Then the council might contract a town planner or an architect
to come up with some possible designs for a new road system.
I’m not sure how exactly the process of creating a pedestrian street
would work, but I imagine that it would require detailed planning.
Perhaps a bypass would need to be built around the town centre first.
This would give drivers a faster alternative to driving through the town,
and it would allow the main shopping street to be blocked off and
pedestrianised.
I’d like to see this change because it would really improve the quality of
life of residents in the town where I live. I can imagine the new
pedestrian street having cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating. It
would be a safer and more pleasant place for families to go shopping,
and I’m sure this would have a positive knock-on effect on local shops
and businesses.
