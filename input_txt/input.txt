Another benefit is that this policy helps reduce social inequality, particularly for older individuals. My experienced professionals, for instance, are unfairly rejected due to age, even when they possess valuable expertise. By projecting them from discrimination, anti-age laws allow for extended careers and improved financial security later in life.

It is true that prohibiting age discrimination can promote fairness and equal opportunities in the labour market. One significant advantage is that it encourages a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Candidates of different age groups, whether younger or older, bring distinctive skills, experiences, and perspectives that enhance cooperation and creativity within the workplace. As a result, fair recruitment practices can strengthen team cohesion and stimulate innovation. Another benefit is that such legislation helps reduce social inequality, particularly among older workers. Many experienced professionals, for example, are unfairly excluded from employment despite their valuable expertise. By protecting them from discrimination, anti-age laws enable longer careers and greater financial stability in later life.

However, enforcing such regulations may come with particular limitations which undermine their intended benefits. One notable issue is that employers might still find indirect ways to discriminate. Bias can persist during interviews, or companies may use coded language in job advertisements to subtly exclude certain age groups. Consequently, legal protection  alone may not be sufficient to eliminate age-related prejudice in hiring practices. Another concern is that certain jobs have physical requirements that may not align with all applicantsâ€™ capabilities. For example, roles involving manual labour or high physical endurance may be less suitable for older candidates. In such cases, mandatory inclusion could result in mismatches between workers and job demands, potentially affecting performance and safety.
